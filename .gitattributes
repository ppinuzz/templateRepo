# CONFIGURATION FILE TO ALLOW GIT TO HANDLE LINE ENDINGS PROPERLY
# ('core.autocrlf' is NOT RECOMMENED, as it doesn't behave properly)
#
# Meaning of the most common options
# 	text=auto		autodetect text files and convert CRLF -> LF
#	text			convert CRLF -> LF
#	-text			never perform the conversion
#	text eol=crlf	convert all to CRLF (for files that MUST retain CRLF even on Linux)
#	text eol=crlf	convert all to CRLF (for files that MUST retain LF even on Windows)
#	binary			autodetect text files and don't touch them
#
# SOME NOTES:
# 1) all conversions apply while "uploading" to Git, when you "download" the 
# files the LF gets converted to CRLF on Windows and to LF on Linux
# ("upload" = write to the object database in the .git folder)
# ("download" = write to the working directory)
#
# 2) ALWAYS specify the binary files explicitly to avoid data corruption

# IF YOU ADD THIS FILE AFTER THE CREATION OF THE REPO:
# "apply" the rules in the .gitattributes file to all the repo to ensure that
# all the files behaves as prescribed by the .gitattributes file by running
# git rm -rf --cached .
# git reset --hard HEAD

# BASIC .gitattributes FROM https://github.com/gitattributes/gitattributes
#
# Set the DEFAULT behaviour (if a file is not found in the list below, Git falls 
# to the core.autocrlf setting, which is unreliable and not portable. To
# prevent this, define a default behaviour)
#	always perform CRLF -> LF
*	text=auto

#
# The above will handle all files NOT found below
